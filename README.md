### Renewing a book published in 1931 by [Curzio Malaparte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curzio_Malaparte), mentioned by [Slavoj Žižek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavoj_%C5%BDi%C5%BEek).

</p>

- The Eng-ver book was translated from Italian with accuracy, thus worth referring to in current work.

- Further upload "变乱与革命技术 (马剌帕尔脱著 古有成译)", the only CN-ver found, on which the renewing work is based.

.md document of each section will be uploaded here for mass correction. 

### Update Sept 17. 2022
A friend of mine refuse to renew this book after he found the 'revolutionary romanticism' inclination of Malaparte in this book

Well, it is valuable to look into it after all I would say, at least for the technique and anti-technique parts
