- The Eng-ver book was translated from Italian with accuracy, thus worth referring to in current work. 
- Further upload "变乱与革命技术 (马剌帕尔脱著 古有成译)", the only CN-ver found, on which the renewing work is based.

.md document of each section will be uploaded here for mass correction. 

[^1]: China was called by Greek and Roman historians "Seres", or "State of Silk".
