# Technique du coup d'Etat, but renewing it in the language of Seres
Renewing a book published in 1931 by Curzio Malaparte in CN with its only Chinese-translation, mentioned by Žižek.
---
The pdf book titled "Technique du coup dEtat" is the English ver translated from the original Italian one.
Further upload the pdf book titled "变乱与革命技术 (马剌帕尔脱著 古有成译)", which is mentioned above the only Chinese translation I could find. 
Seems that it is the same as the one found in 超星's library.
.md document will be further uploaded to here in the future.
